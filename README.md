# DOME-TRON
I have a weird fondness for tron as a warmup for any programming language, and I was just made aware of wren's existence, so now here's another tron clone made with the wonderful [dome engine](https://github.com/domeengine/dome) by [Aviv Beeri](https://github.com/avivbeeri) and co.
## to run: 
 1. clone the repo
   - `git clone https://github.com/nerdwithcomputers/dome-tron`
 2. cd to the directory it clones to
 3. run the `dome` executable either by double clicking it or running `./dome` in the terminal
